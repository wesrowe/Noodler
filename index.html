			<h2>Use Your Eyes, Not Your Ari+hmetic</h2>
			<p>Humans are slow at arithmetic, yet that's exactly what comparison tables full of numbers require.  There are between 200 and 1000 numbers on a grid-based car comparison.  "In your head" is out the window.</p>
			<p>Noodler draws your eye to the <i><strong>outliers</strong></i> among a group of cars.  You don't have to waste your time reading all the numbers.  Your eyes will immediately recognize the "S" shape of a tradeoff, too, where a car is good in one spec and bad in another.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="save_time" class="feature text_left">
			<h2>Save Time by Narrowing Your Options</h2>
			<p>See at a glance if a car has a deal-breaker spec, like not fitting in your garage. Before you waste a Saturday at a dealership.  Before you throw away hours reading reviews.  Save yourself the hassle and energy &ndash; Noodle it before you do anything else.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="compare_more" class="feature text_right">
			<h2>Compare More Vehicles</h2>
			<p>Grid-based research websites max out at 4 or 5 cars at a time.  Not that you could read it anyway.</p>
			<p>Noodler lays one car over another.  Interactive highlighting tames the crowding.</p>
			<p>You can also remove a car from the picture, and it will be waiting for you under "My Cars" when you want another look.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="drill_down" class="feature text_left">
			<h2>Get the Overview...</h2>
			<p>See how cars compare overall for a type of spec in collapsed view. This also helps hide things you don't care as much about.</p>
			<h2>...and then Drill Down</h2>
			<p>Expand areas you care about to see individual components of a spec area.  Noodler will even give you the numbers themselves, just hover or tap on a dot to get the spec itself.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="car_you_know" class="feature text_right">
			<h2>It's All Relative, so add a car you know well</h2>
			<p>Car specs are meaningless on their own.  So add a car you know well to see at a glance how a new car compares to your current ride.  Or, you could compare your first car to a Ferrari.  Just an idea.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="take_with" class="feature text_left">
			<h2>Take it with you.</h2>
			<p>There is no other car research tool that fits so comfortably in a pocket.  If the car salesman tells you something you don't think is right, whip out a Noodle.  You certainly can't whip out a laptop.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="explore" class="feature text_right">
			<h2>Discover Something</h2>
			<p>Easily grab any popular new car from a dropdown and see at a glance if it's worth exploring.  Maybe you'll discover something new!  Or maybe you'll be the first to answer the age-old question, "Is there any difference between an SUV and a crossover?"</p>
